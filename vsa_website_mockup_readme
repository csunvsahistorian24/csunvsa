Mockup 1: Minimalist Elegance
Layout:

Clean and simple layout with ample white space.
Top navigation bar in black with pastel peach text for main sections (About Us, Events, Contact).
Hero section spanning the full width of the screen. Background image: A high-resolution photo showcasing a club activity (e.g., members participating in a debate, volunteering project, etc.). Overlayed text in a large, bold pastel peach font with a brief tagline for the club and a call to action button (e.g., "Join Us!").
Sections below the hero section:
"About Us": Black text on a white background with a brief description of the club, its mission, and its activities. Include a high-quality logo in pastel peach and black.
"Events": Black text on a white background with a list of upcoming events. Each event entry has a title, date, time, and a short description. Emphasize important events with a subtle pastel peach background highlight.
"Contact": Black text on a white background with contact information (email address, social media links) colored in pastel peach.
Modern Design Elements:

Use of subtle animations on hover effects (e.g., text slightly enlarges, slight color shift).
Integration of high-quality photos throughout the website.
Responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
